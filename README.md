# Learning Stuff for Fun
In this repository, I will be documenting things that I learn on the side for fun. It's a space to keep track of my interests. This can go from thought experiments to new programming languages. 

## Me
To give a bit of context on how I'm diving into certain topics. Some topics might not start from super novice level because of base knowledge. Other topics I know nothing about and have to start like a noob:
* PhD in Software Engineering (in progress, 1 year left hopefully)
* Background in maths
* 10+ years programming experience
* 5+ years research experience
* Trying to become a prof
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=EDeAYeYAAAAJ&hl)
